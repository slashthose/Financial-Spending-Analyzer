# 💰 Personal Finance Spending Analyzer

## 📌 Overview

Managing personal finances can be challenging when hundreds of transactions accumulate over time. Most people know how much they earn but often lack visibility into where their money is actually being spent.

The Personal Finance Spending Analyzer is a data analytics project that transforms raw transaction data into meaningful financial insights. Using Python-based data analysis techniques, the project cleans, categorizes, analyzes, and visualizes financial transactions to help users better understand their spending habits and overall financial health.

The project goes beyond basic expense tracking by generating automated insights, calculating a custom Financial Health Score, identifying unusual spending behavior through anomaly detection, and providing budget recommendations based on historical transaction patterns.

An interactive Streamlit dashboard enables users to explore their financial data in a simple and intuitive way.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

* Analyze personal transaction data effectively.
* Understand spending behavior across different categories.
* Identify areas where expenses can be reduced.
* Track savings and financial performance over time.
* Detect unusually large or suspicious expenses.
* Generate meaningful financial insights automatically.
* Create a user-friendly analytics dashboard for decision-making.
